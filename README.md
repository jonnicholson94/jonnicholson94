## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.


I'm currently a Product Manager, looking to transition across into an engineer role. I first started teaching myself to code back in 2019, and absolutely fell in love with it. My first project was for a website called 'thedinnertable', which aimed to bring people together via supper clubs. Since then, I've worked on a number of different projects, including:

- cv-builder | [cv-builder](https://cv-builder.app) | a cv building tool
- kanby | [kanby](https://kanby.vercel.app) | a straightforward kanban board
- lemio | [lemiomoney](https://lemio-rho.vercel.app) | an app to track and manage all of your debts
- la passion | [lapassionhair.co.uk](http://lapassionhair.co.uk) | a website for a local hairdresser (no longer online)
- blockpool | [blockpool.vercel.app](https://blockpool.vercel.app) | a website to view the latest prices on the biggest crypto assets

Coming up: 
- emble | a waiting list API

In terms of my stack, I'd list it as follows:

- React
- Typescript
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

I'm now at a stage where I can comfortably build React webapps, and I'm looking to increase the scalability / reliability of these apps through Typescript. Then for any backend work, I've generally used Node.js, and found it to be pretty performant on the whole. 

Most of my apps are hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and use serverless functions through them instead of a traditional backend setup. I've loved using serverless functions - they're easy to get going, scalable and fast, without all the hassle of creating a full backend. 

However, with my next project (emble), I'm intending to build and deploy a full backend - since it's an API.
