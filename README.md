## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.

I‚Äôm a self-taught dev, looking to move from being a Product Manager to become a Junior Frontend / Fullstack Engineer. 

I‚Äôve been building my own projects for the last 5 years now, and have strong experience in React and Node.js. However, I‚Äôm striving to be language / framework agnostic and I‚Äôm happy to learn any language needed to get the job done.

To support this, I‚Äôve recently been teaching myself core Computer Science fundamentals, focusing specifically on data structures and algorithms.

### My technical skills

- Languages: Javascript, TypeScript, Go
- Frameworks / libraries: React, Next.js, Node.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- Tools/platforms: AWS, Docker, Jest, React Testing Library, PostgreSQL, Cloudflare
- Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms, API Development

### Emble

[Emble](https://emble.app) is my showpiece project! 

It's an app that enables teams to get high quality video feedback from their users on Figma prototypes, websites, and more. 

Since it's a commercial app, and I don't want people to self-host it, I've currently got the source code stored privately. However, at a high level, I've...

- Built the frontend UI using Next.js 14 App Router and TypeScript, implementing many modern React techniques such as suspense, memoisation and more
- Implemented AI functionality using popular LLMs such as OpenAI and Claude 
- Styled with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for animations
- Built a Node.js API which communicates with a PostgreSQL database and is consumed by the Next.js client app
- Utilised AWS S3 for blob storage, and AWS Lambda‚Äôs for video processing
- Stored videos on Cloudflare Stream for CDN and efficient video delivery
- Deployed the containerised Node.js API onto Fly.io using Docker
- Wrote unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library

### My portfolio projects:

Source code for cv-builder and Kanby projects are on my profile, with deeper breakdowns of the code implementation.

#### cv-builder | [cv-builder-ashy.vercel.app](https://cv-builder-ashy.vercel.app)

An app that helps you build tech CVs, and export them into different templates.

- Wrote the frontend using Next.js's App router, utilising server components to fetch data
- Integrated with Supabase for authentication and storage
- Utilised Radix UI for various different components
- Wrote unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library

#### Kanby | [kanby.vercel.app](https://kanby.vercel.app)

A simple todo app.

- Frontend built using Next.js Pages router
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Integrated with Supabase for authentication and storage
- Zustand for a simple store that contains UI state
- Radix UI for various different components
- Unit tests written using Jest and React Testing Library

There's also a number of old projects that I've worked on before on my GitHub. I've played around with a number of different languages, including Go, Node.js, and more.

### What's next?

I'm now looking to move across into a full time Junior Frontend / Fullstack Engineer role.

I think my experience as a PM has given me great insight into the processes and ways of thinking in order to build a high quality product. Being customer centric, capable of building roadmaps and communicating with other teams around the business, puts me in a great position to be truly autonomous in an engineer role when I combine those skills with my technical ones.
