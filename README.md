## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.

I'm a frontend engineer, currently working as a Product Manager. I love building intuitive user flows, and creating experiences that users will love.

### My portfolio projects:

Source code for cv-builder and Kanby projects are on my profile, with deeper breakdowns of the code implementation. The LOVESPACE check-in tool is stored privately.

#### LOVESPACE check-in tool | [LOVESPACE customer check-in tool v2](https://check-in-v2.vercel.app) | NOT CURRENTLY DEPLOYED TO LIVE

As a project in my current job, I re-built our customer check-in tool to utilise Nuxt 3. It was previously built using Angular, but we're currently in the process of migrating all of our frontend UI, including internal tools, across to Vue 3 or Nuxt 3. It gave me the opportunity to work with some of our frontend devs, conducting code reviews, and utilising internal mechanisms to write code.

- Built the frontend UI using Nuxt 3
- Communicated with our backend using an API class
- Utilised Pinia for storing data and UI state

#### cv-builder | [cv-builder-ashy.vercel.app](https://cv-builder-ashy.vercel.app)

An app that helps you build tech CVs, and export them into different templates.

- Wrote the frontend using Next.js's App router, utilising server components to fetch data
- Integrated with Supabase for authentication and storage
- Utilised Radix UI for various different components
- Wrote unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library

#### Kanby | [kanby.vercel.app](https://kanby.vercel.app)

A simple todo app.

- Frontend built using Next.js Pages router
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- Integrated with Supabase for authentication and storage
- Zustand for a simple store that contains UI state
- Radix UI for various different components
- Unit tests written using Jest and React Testing Library

There's also a number of old projects that I've worked on before on my GitHub. I've played around with a number of different languages, including Go, Node.js, and more.

### What's next?

I'm now looking to move across into a full time frontend engineer role.

I think my experience as a PM has given me great insight into the processes and ways of thinking in order to build a high quality product. Being customer centric, capable of building roadmaps and communicating with other teams around the business, puts me in a great position to be truly autonomous in an engineer role when I combine those skills with my technical ones.

I'm also moving on to building a new startup / side project. For v1, it's an app that will help PMs, designers, or anybody else quickly conduct usability testing on prototypes - but remotely, and asynchronously.
