## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.

I'm currently a Product Manager, but I'm on a journey to transition into a Junior Software Engineer role. I love working on building intuitive user flows, and writing clean code. 

I first started coding back in 2019, learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I've worked on a number of projects, including:

### Projects:

- **Emble** | [emble.app](https://emble.app)
   - A platform for conducting effective user research by embedding prototypes into interactive surveys. Currently in beta. 
   - Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Go.

- **cv-builder** | [cv-builder.app](https://cv-builder.app)
   - A tool for building CVs.
   - Built with Next.js and TypeScript.

- **kanby** | [kanby.vercel.app](https://kanby.vercel.app)
   - A straightforward kanban board.
   - Built with Next.js and TypeScript.

- **lemio** | [lemiomoney.vercel.app](https://lemio-rho.vercel.app)
   - An app to track and manage debts. I got a good number of users signed up to the waiting list (~200) and built an MVP, but decided to close it down rather than pursue it further, since I need to raise money for it.
   - Built with React.

- **blockpool** | [blockpool.vercel.app](https://blockpool.vercel.app)
   - A website for viewing the latest prices of major crypto assets.

The source code for all of these projects are available in my repositories!

I'm particularly proud of what I achieved with Emble. I built the backend from scratch, creating different endpoints and handling errors using a custom error struct. My favourite piece of functionality to build was the reset password endpoint. First, it creates a UUID and stores it in the database when a user requests a reset. Next, it sends a templated email via Resend to the user with a unique link in it. Once the user clicks on the link, it takes them to a callback page, where they can enter a new password that then updates in my database. It's a really good flow, and works well in my opinion!

If you're interested in trying it out for yourself, feel free to drop me a message and I'd be happy setting you up with an account to play around with it in the wild!

### My tech stack:

- React / Next.js

If a skill isn't listed here, I'm enthusiastic about learning new languages and technologies, so I'm more than happy to pick up any new language and run with it.
