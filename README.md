## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.


I'm an aspiring full-stack developer. I first started teaching myself to code back in 2019, and absolutely fell in love with it. My first project was for a website called 'thedinnertable', which aimed to bring people together via supper clubs. Since then, I've worked on a number of different projects, including:

- kanby | [kanby.co](https://kanby.co) | a straightforward kanban board
- lemio | [lemiomoney.com](https://lemiomoney.com) | an app to track and manage all of your debts
- la passion | [lapassionhair.co.uk](http://lapassionhair.co.uk) | a website for a local hairdresser
- blockpool | [blockpool.vercel.app](https://blockpool.vercel.app) | a website to view the latest prices on the biggest crypto assets

In terms of the stack I'm aspiring to, I'd list it as follows:

- React
- Swift
- Go
- PostgreSQL
- Realm

My main motivations for this are that I'd essentially be able to build any app I wanted. React is the classic JavaScript based framework for building frontend apps. I have an iPhone so I'm a bit biased, but Swift would allow me to build apps for iPhones. Go is a super-fast, statically typed language that can be used across web apps and mobile apps (and used by great companies like Monzo). Postgres and Realm would then allow me to create and access great databases across platforms too.

However, in my projects so far, I've used the following languages / frameworks:

- kanby - React, MongoDB, Node.js, Jest
- lemio - React, MongoDB, Node.js, Swift
- la passion - HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- blockpool - React, Go

Kanby, Lemio and Blockpool are all hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and use serverless functions through them instead of a traditional backend setup. I've loved using serverless functions - they're easy to get going, scalable and fast, without all the hassle of creating a full backend. 

In terms of future projects, I'm hoping to build a web app and iOS app for tracking goals. I'd expect this to build on top of kanby and blockpool, and be written in React / Go / Postgres / Swift. The choice of database may flex though, depending upon how I decide to store goals on iOS.
