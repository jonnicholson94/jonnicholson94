## üëãüèº Hey, I'm Jon.


I'm a Product Manager who does a bit of code on the side. I first started teaching myself to code back in 2019, and absolutely fell in love with it. My first project was for a website called 'thedinnertable', which aimed to bring people together via supper clubs. Since then, I've worked on a number of different projects, including:

- kanby | [kanby](https://kanby.vercel.app) | a straightforward kanban board
- lemio | [lemiomoney](https://lemio-rho.vercel.app) | an app to track and manage all of your debts
- la passion | [lapassionhair.co.uk](http://lapassionhair.co.uk) | a website for a local hairdresser
- blockpool | [blockpool.vercel.app](https://blockpool.vercel.app) | a website to view the latest prices on the biggest crypto assets
- blockpool app | same as blockpool website, except built with Swift as a mobile app

In terms of the stack I'm aspiring to learn, I'd list it as follows:

- React
- Typescript
- Go
- PostgreSQL

My main motivations for this are that I'd essentially be able to build any app I wanted. React is the classic JavaScript based framework for building frontend apps. I have an iPhone so I'm a bit biased, but Swift would allow me to build apps for iPhones. Go is a super-fast, statically typed language that can be used across web apps and mobile apps (and used by great companies like Monzo). Postgres and Realm would then allow me to create and access great databases across platforms too.

However, in my projects so far, I've used the following languages / frameworks:

- kanby - React, MongoDB, Node.js, Jest
- lemio - React, MongoDB, Node.js, Swift
- la passion - HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- blockpool web - React, Go
- blockpool app - Swift

Kanby, Lemio and Blockpool are all hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and use serverless functions through them instead of a traditional backend setup. I've loved using serverless functions - they're easy to get going, scalable and fast, without all the hassle of creating a full backend. 

I'm now currently working on a new app which builds a CV for people, and they can choose from different formats - as building a CV is usually pretty annoying!
